You were the catalyst of my (one of many) artistic awakening- and i thank you for playing the role. My new house is a dream come true, and my roommate, well, she makes my dreams come true. 'Relationships' are silly and naive, and by accepting this i've delved sensibly and harmoniously into a world i never knew and i feel clean and above all- [[STRONG]] again.\"   \n",

I really glamorized you as a person, i now know how painfully ordinary and typical you are and i laugh conceitedly to myself and im not ashamed to admit that. \\nI strive to educate through my art, i think its important to have some sort of cohesively moral message in your medium, it justifies any extreme you take it to. People need to experience pain and grief to strengthen their own fundamental beliefs and inner-self. \\nI've been sober for one month today. As insignificant a person you were to me, the impact of your departure had much significance. Again, [[thank you.]]   \n",

I tried to help you be who you always wanted to be and you couldn't offer me a helping hand when I needed it most. I've been so fucking scared of myself this year and you have made me feel more lonely than I ever have. You treat me like I mean so little to you.

I really glamorized you as a person, i now know how painfully ordinary and typical you are and i laugh conceitedly to myself and im not ashamed to admit that. \\nI strive to educate through my art, i think its important to have some sort of cohesively moral message in your medium, it justifies any extreme you take it to. People need to experience pain and grief to strengthen their own fundamental beliefs and inner-self. \\nI've been sober for one month today. As insignificant a person you were to me, the impact of your departure had much significance. Again, [[thank you.]]   \n",

You won't speak to me in person or on the phone because you have no justification- you're fully committed to your selfish desires and you unconditionally take care of yourself with any and all collateral damage thrown aside carelessly. I hate you.

You feed off of playing victim.\"   \n",

You didn't bother trying to share time with me. You didn't follow through with anything you said you'd do on your end. What happened to the artist I fell in love with and demanded she be my best friend? Who are you? I tried to help you be who you always wanted to be and you couldn't offer me a helping hand when I needed it most. I've been so fucking scared of myself this year and you have made me feel more lonely than I ever have. You treat me like I mean so little to you. I doubt I ever meant an ounce of what you meant to me. How could I even expect someone to love me as much as I loved you?\"\\n\\n\\n[[<<Back|≡]]   \n",
